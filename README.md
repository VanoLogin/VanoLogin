### Hi there 👋

## Welcome to My Second Home!

Hello! My name is **Ivan Login**, and I'm a **junior web developer** specializing in creating dynamic interfaces and backend interactions. I'm committed to building convenient and functional web applications that provide an excellent user experience.

## My Skills 💪
- **HTML & CSS:** Creating structured and responsive web pages using modern standards and best practices.
- **JavaScript:** Programming interactive elements and complex web application functions, understanding asynchronous programming, and event handling.
- **DOM (Document Object Model):** Manipulating page elements in real-time, dynamically changing content and styles, allowing for the creation of reactive user interfaces.
- **Backend Interaction:** Working with RESTful APIs for fetching, creating, and updating data. Using Fetch API and Axios for asynchronous requests to the server and managing data within the application.

## My Projects 🏋️🏅
In my projects, I demonstrate the ability to work with the DOM, create interactive user interfaces, and interact with the backend for data processing:
